# DEEPCOVNET-architecture
The architecture was created to diagnose COVID-19 from the chest X-ray images of Normal, Viral Pneumonia and Bacterial Pneumonia. Four-class classification (COVID-19/Normal/Viral Pneumonia/Bacterial Pneumonia) and two types of three-class classification (COVID-19/Normal/Pneumonia) and (Normal/Viral Pneumonia/Bacterial Pneumonia) were performed in the project. We arrived an accuracy of 90.24% for four-class classification and 98.04% and 88.67% for COVID-19/Normal/Pneumonia and Normal/Viral Pneumonia/Bacterial Pneumonia respectively.
